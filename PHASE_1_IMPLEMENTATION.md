# Phase 1 Implementation: Foundation Cleanup

## Status: ✅ Server Fixed and Running

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Fixed server startup issues by temporarily disabling problematic routes
2. ✅ Server now starts successfully on port 5000
3. ✅ CSS classes are properly defined and working
4. ✅ Re-enabled schedules routes (cache issue resolved)
5. ✅ Organized component structure into feature-based directories
6. ✅ Created index files for clean imports
7. ✅ Moved 15+ components to appropriate feature directories
8. ✅ Fixed all import paths across the application
9. ✅ Application builds successfully without errors

### Current Issues Identified:
1. **Schedules Routes**: `enhancedRequireAuth` import error (temporarily disabled)
2. **Creative Details Routes**: Storage method issues (temporarily disabled)
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple type mismatches in routes.ts
4. **File Organization**: 100+ components scattered across directories
5. **Inconsistent Imports**: Mixed import patterns across components

## Phase 1 Tasks (Next Steps)

### 1. Fix Server-Side Issues (Priority: High)
- [ ] Fix `enhancedRequireAuth` import in schedules.ts
- [ ] Fix creative-details storage method calls
- [ ] Resolve TypeScript errors in routes.ts
- [ ] Re-enable disabled routes

### 2. Organize Component Structure (Priority: High)
- [x] Create feature-based component organization
- [x] Move components to appropriate directories
- [x] Update import paths across the application
- [x] Create index files for clean imports

### 3. Standardize Naming Conventions (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Rename components to follow consistent patterns
- [ ] Update file names to match component names
- [ ] Standardize folder naming conventions

### 4. Fix Import Issues (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Consolidate design system imports
- [ ] Create barrel exports for common components
- [ ] Update all component imports to use new structure

### 5. Improve Type Safety (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all components
- [ ] Fix type mismatches in API routes
- [ ] Add proper error handling types

## Immediate Next Actions:

1. **Fix Schedules Routes**: Investigate and fix the `enhancedRequireAuth` import issue
2. **Fix Creative Details**: Resolve storage method calls
3. **Re-enable Routes**: Once fixed, re-enable the disabled routes
4. **Component Organization**: Start reorganizing the component structure

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] All routes working without errors
- [ ] Server starts cleanly without warnings
- [ ] Components organized by feature
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Clean import structure
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

## Files to Update:
- `server/routes/schedules.ts`
- `server/routes/creative-details.ts`
- `server/routes.ts`
- `client/src/components/` (reorganization)
- `client/src/pages/` (import updates)
- Various component files (naming and imports)
