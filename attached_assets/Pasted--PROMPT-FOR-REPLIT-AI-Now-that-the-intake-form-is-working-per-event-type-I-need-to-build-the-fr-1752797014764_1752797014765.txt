// PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI:

Now that the intake form is working per event type, I need to build the front-end for **dynamic dashboards** and **section modules** that change depending on the selected event (e.g., Wedding, Birthday, Dinner Party).

1. üß≠ GOAL
- After a user completes (or skips through) the intake form, they should be routed to a dashboard that reflects their selected event type.
- Each event should have:
  - A customized dashboard view (title, welcome message, layout)
  - A specific set of planning sections (e.g., checklist, budget, timeline, vendors, design ideas, etc.)
  - AI suggestions populated based on the intake responses (can be mocked or left as placeholder for now)

2. üóÇÔ∏è CONFIG FILE SETUP
- Create a new config file: `eventDashboardConfigs.js`
- This should export an object that defines the layout and modules per event type.
- Each event should define:
  - `title`
  - `welcomeMessage`
  - `sections`: an array of section IDs (used to render components)

Example:
```js
export const eventDashboardConfigs = {
  wedding: {
    title: "Your Wedding HQ",
    welcomeMessage: "Let‚Äôs make your big day unforgettable.",
    sections: ['countdown', 'checklist', 'budget', 'guestList', 'vendors', 'designBoard']
  },
  birthday: {
    title: "Birthday Bash Builder",
    welcomeMessage: "Time to celebrate in style!",
    sections: ['countdown', 'checklist', 'budget', 'activities', 'designBoard']
  },
  dinnerParty: {
    title: "Dinner Party Planner",
    welcomeMessage: "Hosting has never been easier.",
    sections: ['timeline', 'menuPlanner', 'guestList', 'seatingChart', 'notes']
  },
  babyShower: {
    title: "Baby Shower Studio",
    welcomeMessage: "Let‚Äôs celebrate the little one on the way!",
    sections: ['countdown', 'checklist', 'budget', 'registry', 'games', 'designBoard']
  },
  proposal: {
    title: "Proposal Planning Hub",
    welcomeMessage: "Let‚Äôs make the moment unforgettable.",
    sections: ['timeline', 'locationIdeas', 'vendorSupport', 'scriptIdeas', 'surprisePlan']
  }
}
