🎨 Design:
- Use Tailwind CSS for clean layout and consistent styling
- Rounded corners, light blush/cream background, drop shadow cards
- Fun emoji or icon at the top of each section (e.g. 🍹🪧📸🎶)
- Collapsible panels for mobile friendliness
- Floating “+ Add New” button for adding custom fields within each section

📦 Technical:
- Store each category’s data in state or localStorage for now
- Build reusable components (e.g. EditableCard, UploadSection)
- Prepare components to later support backend save or sync

🧠 Bonus:
- Add an “Ask AI for Ideas” button in Signature Drinks, Songs, DIY Projects, and Moodboard
- Create a mini activity log (who updated what and when)
