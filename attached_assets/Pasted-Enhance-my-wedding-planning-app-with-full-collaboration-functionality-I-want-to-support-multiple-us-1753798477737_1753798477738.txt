Enhance my wedding planning app with full collaboration functionality. I want to support multiple users (e.g., bride, groom, planner, mother-of-the-bride) being able to log in and access the same wedding instance, with different permissions and activity tracking.

Here’s what I need:

---

🧩 DATABASE MODELS

1. Add the following tables/models:
- `User`: id, name, email, passwordHash, role
- `Wedding`: id, coupleName, date, location, etc.
- `WeddingUser`: id, userId (FK), weddingId (FK), role ("admin" | "editor" | "viewer")
- `ActivityLog`: id, weddingId (FK), userId (FK), action, timestamp

---

🔐 AUTH & ACCOUNT LINKING

2. Set up secure auth (using sessions or JWT):
- Allow users to sign up/log in
- After logging in, users can either:
  a. Create a new wedding
  b. Join an existing wedding if invited
- A user can be linked to multiple weddings via the `WeddingUser` join table

---

📧 INVITE FLOW

3. Build an “Invite a collaborator” flow:
- UI component in the dashboard to invite users by email
- Select role (editor/viewer/admin)
- Generate a unique invite token (JWT or UUID)
- Send invite link via email (or display copyable link)
- When invitee clicks the link, they’re prompted to sign up and are linked to the correct wedding

---

✅ PERMISSION CONTROL

4. Add middleware that:
- Checks if a user is associated with the current wedding
- Checks their role (e.g., only admins can update budget)
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized actions

---

📜 ACTIVITY LOGGING

5. On all major user actions (e.g. adding a task, editing vendor, uploading a file), automatically log to `ActivityLog` with:
- User ID
- Wedding ID
- Action description (string)
- Timestamp

Then:
- Build a front-end view of the activity log (timeline or list)
- Format like: “Kat updated the guest list — 2 hours ago”

---

🖥️ DASHBOARD IMPROVEMENTS

6. On the dashboard:
- Show a list of all collaborators and their roles
- Allow admins to remove collaborators or change their roles
- Show recent activity (latest 5-10 actions)

---

🧪 OPTIONAL EXTRAS

7. Add soft animations when new collaborators are added
8. Add drag-and-drop reordering for guests or tasks (if not already)
9. Include “You” badges when showing logged-in user in collaborator lists

---

Use Node + Express on the backend, Prisma or raw SQL for DB if needed, React with Tailwind on the front end, and make sure it works within my current Replit setup.
