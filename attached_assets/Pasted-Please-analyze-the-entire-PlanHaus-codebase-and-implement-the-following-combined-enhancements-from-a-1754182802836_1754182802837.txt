Please analyze the entire PlanHaus codebase and implement the following combined enhancements from all review, enhancement, and analysis documents in the repo:

1. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Apply all recommendations from `UI_UX_COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW.md`.
   - Refine dashboard visual hierarchy with wedding-themed depth (card shadows, soft borders, color palette).
   - Add a Quick Stats bar showing: wedding countdown, budget remaining, and tasks due this week.
   - Add trend indicators (↗️ improving, ↘️ needs attention) to progress cards.
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for multi-step workflows.
   - Improve typography hierarchy and spacing consistency.
   - Enhance form validation and user feedback with inline error messages and toast notifications.
   - Add smooth animations, hover effects, and subtle micro-interactions.
   - Implement skeleton loaders for slow-loading sections.
   - Ensure full mobile responsiveness and touch-friendly interactions.

2. **TypeScript & Bug Fixes**
   - Scan and fix all TypeScript errors, avoiding `any` unless absolutely necessary.
   - Resolve import path mismatches, missing schema definitions, and property access issues on unknown types.
   - Ensure components are strongly typed with proper interfaces.
   - Fix TypeScript issues in:
     - `client/src/components/DragDropTimeline.tsx`
     - `client/src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx`
     - `client/src/components/ProjectOverview.tsx`
   - Verify API endpoint consistency (match client calls to backend routes).
   - Fix all runtime errors and broken interactions.

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA labels and semantic HTML to all interactive elements.
   - Add `aria-describedby` or `DialogDescription` to all `DialogContent` components.
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation support.
   - Improve contrast ratios and add reduced-motion support.
   - Ensure hover and focus states are clearly visible.

4. **Authentication Improvements**
   - Fix API calls returning 401 errors by implementing proper token refresh or session handling.
   - Ensure authenticated routes gracefully handle expired sessions and re-authentication.

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize image sizes and implement lazy loading for large inspiration images.
   - Implement progressive loading for heavy components.
   - Use `React.memo` for expensive re-rendering components.
   - Deduplicate API queries and ensure correct enabled conditions in `useQuery` hooks.
   - Batch related API calls for dashboard stats.
   - Make TanStack Query cache cleanup more aggressive to reduce memory usage.
   - Minimize layout shift (CLS) and improve Core Web Vitals.

6. **Advanced Features**
   - Add an AI-powered "Next Steps" panel on the dashboard that recommends actions based on the wedding timeline.
   - Implement auto-save for forms.
   - Wrap key areas in `ErrorBoundary` with retry buttons.
   - Add comprehensive error boundaries and proper loading states for all pages.

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Confirm no console errors or TypeScript build errors remain.
   - Verify that users can successfully add, edit, and delete items across all features without breaking.
   - Ensure accessibility tests pass.

After implementation, summarize the changes in a markdown file called `UI_UX_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` and note any trade-offs or decisions made during execution.
