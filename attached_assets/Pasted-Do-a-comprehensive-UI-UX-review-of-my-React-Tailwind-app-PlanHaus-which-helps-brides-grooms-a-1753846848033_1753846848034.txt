Do a comprehensive UI/UX review of my React + Tailwind app (PlanHaus), which helps brides, grooms, and planners collaborate on wedding planning.

The audience is mostly DIY brides and planners, so the interface should be elegant, intuitive, mobile-friendly, and emotionally delightful.

🔍 Analyze all key areas and suggest improvements:

- Is the main dashboard intuitive and visually organized?
- Should I be using card-based layouts or a sidebar nav?

📱 2. **Responsiveness & Mobile Optimization**
- Check all views for mobile usability and responsiveness.

- Does the navigation flow feel natural for first-time users?

- Are onboarding or AI assistant features easy to discover and use?
- Are there clear calls to action (e.g., "Start Planning", "Upload Moodboard")?

- Review loading indicators or skeleton loaders — are they helpful and styled well?

🔓 7. **Accessibility (a11y)**
- Are font sizes and contrasts WCAG-compliant?
- Do I have skip links or semantic HTML?
- Can users tab through interactive elements?

🔐 8. **Personalization & Delight**
- Suggest small UI touches that surprise and delight users (e.g., AI welcome messages, name personalization).
- Any microinteractions,
