Create a modern, responsive marketing/landing page for PlanHaus, a wedding planning web app, with the following requirements:

1. **Overall Goals**
   - Clearly explain what PlanHaus is, who it’s for, and the value it brings.
   - Encourage visitors to either "Try Now" or "Log In" to the app.
   - Match the app’s wedding-themed design aesthetic (soft color palette, elegant typography, subtle animations).

2. **Sections**
   - **Hero Section**:
     - Headline: “A Smarter Way to Plan Your Best Day — With AI That Gets You”
     - Subheadline: Briefly describe the app’s key benefits (personalized planning, AI assistance, organized checklists, budget tracking).
     - Call-to-Action Buttons:
       - “Try Now” → Link to `https://YOUR-REPLIT-APP-URL/login`
       - “Log In” → Link to `https://YOUR-REPLIT-APP-URL/login`
     - Background: Optional soft gradient, wedding-related image, or subtle floral pattern.

   - **Features Section**:
     - Display 3–5 key features with icons or illustrations:
       - AI Planning Assistant
       - Budget Tracker
       - Vendor & Guest List Management
       - Custom Timeline & Checklist
       - Moodboard & Inspiration Board
     - Include short descriptions under each.

   - **How It Works**:
     - Simple 3-step flow:
       1. Sign up and tell us about your event.
       2. Get your personalized wedding plan instantly.
       3. Track, update, and collaborate until the big day.

   - **Screenshots or Demo**:
     - Include mockups or screenshots of the dashboard, timeline, and moodboard features.
     - Use placeholders if real assets aren’t ready.

   - **Testimonials / Social Proof**:
     - Include 2–3 short quotes from “users” (can be mock for now).

   - **FAQ Section**:
     - Answer common questions like: "Do I need to pay?", "Can I collaborate with my partner?", "Does this work for other events?"

   - **Footer**:
     - Company name & © year
     - Social links (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok)
     - Contact email

3. **Design Requirements**
   - Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Use soft pastel colors, elegant typography (like serif or calligraphy-style for headings), and lots of white space.
   - Smooth scroll behavior.
   - Subtle hover animations on buttons and links.
   - Light but visually appealing — minimal clutter.

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Build in React (if project already uses it) or HTML/CSS with optional TailwindCSS.
   - Separate styling into `landing.css` or Tailwind classes for maintainability.
   - Include all images as optimized web-ready assets or use placeholder URLs.
   - Link all CTA buttons to: `https://YOUR-REPLIT-APP-URL/login`.

Deliver the page as `LandingPage.tsx` (or `landing.html` if standalone) and integrate it so visiting `/` on the domain loads this marketing page, while `/login` continues to load the app’s login page.
